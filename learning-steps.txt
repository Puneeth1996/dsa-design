How to use Leet Code Effectively



- Start with Easy and High Acceptance. Than Progress to Easy and Lesser Acceptance. ... Medium and Higher.

- Take up interview question, and also search SDE Sheet Interview Questions.

- Start with a problem, check the like and dislike ratio, avoid those where many dislikes are present.

- To check the solution for a problem. Even if non premium account, check the discussion form. Check the "most votes" section and replies in them.


-Consistance for 6-7 months. With Easy, medium , hard problems. Keep 1(Easy) : 2(Medium) : 1(Hard). Participate in Leetcode challenges, would be similar to interview situations.
This would help in refferal to big tech companies with LeetCode and Compitative Programming.


- start with different topic in order as per learning order. Make your own learning notes on each topic as you face them.

- Maintain good Leet code profile.
